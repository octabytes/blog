I have a website with domain OctaByte.io where I provide fully managed services for open source applications. I have around 350+ open source softwares. Here is short description about OctaByte "OctaByte is Fully managed platform to deploy your favorite open-source applications just in minutes. Effortlessly deploy and manage open source software with our fully managed DevOps platform, streamlining the entire process for you."

People just come to OctaByte and choose the application and provide email and other detail and start trial we provide 7 days free trial customers can cancel subscription at anytime.

I created a blog for OctaByte where I want to write some posts for better SEO. So I want you to write a post about "Corteza" if you don't know "Corteza" then here is little description about this "A low-code platform alternative to Salesforce lets you build and iterate CRM, business processes and other structured data apps fast, create intelligent business process workflows, and connect with almost any data source."

I want you to write a post about "Deploy Corteza in Minutes with OctaByte.io" also write short description, title and keywords. Post should be focused on SEO. And also write a post in markdown format
