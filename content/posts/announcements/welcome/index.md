We are happy to announce that we're launching [octabyte.io](https://octabyte.io) to the public.

[octabyte.io](https://octabyte.io) is the simplest way to start using open\-source software for your business or projects.


> As open\-source fanatics, we're really happy to make open\-source more accessible and more reliable \+ hassle\-free for many businesses, IT departments, or freelancers who want to own their own data.


> With our platform, you can deploy any one of over ***250\+*** supported software services on a dedicated instance in less than 3 minutes, and we take care of everything else: installation, configuration, encryption, backups, software \& OS updates, and live monitoring are all Included.

For example, you can set up a wiki for your business with [Wiki.js](https://octabyte.io/applications/documentation/wikijs) or [BookStack](https://octabyte.io/applications/documentation/bookstack), collaborate with your team (and save tons of money) using [Mattermost](https://octabyte.io/applications/live-chat/mattermost), set up a blog or website with [Ghost](https://octabyte.io/applications/cms/ghost) (that's what powers this blog), Improve your website/digital app using [Sentry](https://octabyte.io/hosting-and-infrastructure/monitoring/glitchtip), [Healthchecks](https://octabyte.io/development/dev-ops/healthchecks), [Uptime Kuma](https://octabyte.io/hosting-and-infrastructure/monitoring/uptime-kuma), [SigNoz](https://octabyte.io/hosting-and-infrastructure/monitoring/signoz), or [Syncthing](https://octabyte.io/hosting-and-infrastructure/storage/syncthing) (or [Filestash](https://octabyte.io/hosting-and-infrastructure/storage/filestash) ).

Please, check out the [list of fully managed open source softwares](https://octabyte.io/all-services/) we support!

### Automated Updates

Keeping your open source software up to date doesn't have to make you cringe. Choose a maintenance window that works for you, and let us handle the rest.

### Automated Security

We deploy your service with sane defaults, fully managed SSL certificates, application\-sensitive firewall rules, rate limiting, and secure root credentials (where applicable).

### Automated Backups

octabyte.io automatically implements an industry\-standard backup strategy to protect you from accidental or malicious loss of data. No matter the reason, you can restore your data in minutes with a single click.

### Globally private Multi\-cloud IPv4 network

Project\-scoped services are automatically connected to a private IPv4 network that spans datacenters, regions and providers using mutually authenticated certificates.
