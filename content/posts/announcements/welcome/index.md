After 6 years as an internal tool, and 12 months of development, we're launching elest.io to the public.

elest.io is the simplest way to start using open\-source software for your business or projects.


> As open\-source fanatics, we're really happy to make open\-source more accessible and more reliable \+ hassle\-free for many businesses, IT departments, or freelancers who want to own their own data.


> With our platform, you can deploy any one of over ***250\+*** supported software services on a dedicated instance in less than 3 minutes, and we take care of everything else: installation, configuration, encryption, backups, software \& OS updates, and live monitoring are all Included.

For example, you can set up a wiki for your business with [Wiki.js](https://elest.io/open-source/wikijs?ref=blog.elest.io) or [BookStack](https://elest.io/open-source/bookstack?ref=blog.elest.io), collaborate with your team (and save tons of money) using [Mattermost](https://elest.io/open-source/mattermost?ref=blog.elest.io), set up a blog or website with [Ghost](https://elest.io/open-source/ghost?ref=blog.elest.io) (that's what powers this blog), Improve your website/digital app using [Sentry](https://elest.io/open-source/sentry?ref=blog.elest.io), [Healthchecks](https://elest.io/open-source/healthchecks?ref=blog.elest.io), [Uptime Kuma](https://elest.io/open-source/uptime-kuma?ref=blog.elest.io), [SigNoz](https://elest.io/open-source/signoz?ref=blog.elest.io), or even simply set up your own secure file syncing and sharing tool using [Seafile](https://elest.io/open-source/seafile?ref=blog.elest.io) or [Syncthing](https://elest.io/open-source/syncthing?ref=blog.elest.io) (or [Filestash](https://elest.io/open-source/filestash?ref=blog.elest.io) ).

Please, check out the [list of fully managed open source softwares](https://elest.io/fully-managed-services?ref=blog.elest.io) we support!

### Do we really take care of everything?


> If you mean: [free SSL certificates](https://doc.elest.io/books/security/page/automated-encryption-ssltls?ref=blog.elest.io), even for your own domain, [3\-2\-1 backups](https://doc.elest.io/books/backups/page/overview?ref=blog.elest.io) including [snapshots of app and OS state](https://doc.elest.io/books/backups/page/vm-snapshots?ref=blog.elest.io), automatic encrypted mesh networking, [L4 \& L7 firewall](https://doc.elest.io/books/security/page/network-firewall?ref=blog.elest.io), [rate limiting](https://doc.elest.io/books/security/page/ip-rate-limiter?ref=blog.elest.io), [caching](https://doc.elest.io/books/security/page/output-cache?ref=blog.elest.io), [monitoring](https://doc.elest.io/books/service-dashboard/page/metrics?ref=blog.elest.io) and [alerts](https://doc.elest.io/books/service-dashboard/page/alerts?ref=blog.elest.io), [automatic non\-breaking updates that respect semantic versioning](https://docs.elest.io/books/service-dashboard/page/software-os-updates-configuration?ref=blog.elest.io).... yes.

### Automated Updates

Keeping your open source software up to date doesn't have to make you cringe. Choose a maintenance window that works for you, and let us handle the rest.

### Automated Security

We deploy your service with sane defaults, fully managed SSL certificates, application\-sensitive firewall rules, rate limiting, and secure root credentials (where applicable).

### Automated Backups

elest.io automatically implements an industry\-standard backup strategy to protect you from accidental or malicious loss of data. No matter the reason, you can restore your data in minutes with a single click.

### Globally private Multi\-cloud IPv4 network

Project\-scoped services are automatically connected to a private IPv4 network that spans datacenters, regions and providers using mutually authenticated certificates.
