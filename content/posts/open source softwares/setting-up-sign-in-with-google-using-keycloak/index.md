Hey everyone, in this blog we will be setting up the "Sign in with Google" option using Keycloak. We will be using a self\-hosted Keycloak instance deployed on Elestio. So, to get started head over to [Elestio Dashboard](https://elest.io/open-source/keycloak?ref=blog.elest.io) and deploy and login into the Keycloak instance to get started.

## Creating New Realm

According to the Keycloak documentation


> A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

Once you are logged in, head over to the drop\-down menu on the top left hand. It is important to notice that there is a realm "***Keycloak master***" already available. This realm has higher privileges hence it is recommended to create a new realm. Click on "***Create realm***".

```
https://YOUR_KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN/auth/realms/YOUR_REALM_NAME/broker/google/endpoint
```
Head over to next section to get the information to be filled out in this step.

## Create Google Application

Head over to [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/?ref=blog.elest.io), login in to the console using Google account and you will see Google Developer Console.

Once logged in, head over the top left drop\-down to create new project.

If not then head over to the *Dashboard* and head over to "***Explore and enable APIs"*** options. Then Click on "***Credentials"** \> "**Configure Consent Screen"*** and head over to the next step.

* Application type: Public
* Application name: Your application name
* Authorised domains: Your application top\-level domain name
* Application Homepage link: Your application homepage
* Application Privacy Policy link: Your application privacy policy link

Now head over to the *Create Credentials* option in the navbar and click on "***OAuth Client ID"**.*

Next, Add the link provided in the Keycloak tab under "***Authorized Redirect URIs"*** and click "***Create"***. The link should look something like this


```
https://YOUR_KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN/auth/realms/YOUR_REALM_NAME/broker/google/endpoint
```

You will need to "***Client ID"*** and "***Client secret"*** in next step so make sure you make a safe copy of it.

Add the copied credentials in the Keycloak Google provider section and click on the "***Add"*** button.
