## What is Listmonk?

Listmonk is an open\-source email solution that offers a range of features to help you streamline your email communication with your subscribers. With Listmonk, you can send marketing campaigns, transactional emails, manage your subscriber lists, automate your email workflows, customize your email templates, and track real\-time analytics.

## Listmonk Features

**Campaigns:** Listmonk makes it easy to create and send email campaigns that look professional and engaging. You can design your templates with your branding, add images and links, and segment your audience based on their interests or behavior. It supports HTML, RTE, Markdown, and plain text format.

**Transactional emails:** Listmonk also supports transactional emails, which are automated messages triggered by specific actions, such as a sign\-up confirmation or a password reset. You can customize the content and design of these emails to match your brand voice and style. Unfortunately, it doesn't include analytics but you can add any email tracker solution of your choice if needed.

**Subscriber management:** Listmonk allows you to manage your subscribers in lists and forms. You can add or remove subscribers, segment them based on their preferences, and create signup forms that integrate with your website or landing pages.

**Automation:** With Listmonk, you can set up automated workflows that send targeted messages based on triggers, such as a new subscriber, a specific date, or an action taken on your website. This helps you save time and boost engagement.

**Customization:** Listmonk gives you complete control over your email templates, so you can make them look exactly the way you want. You can use HTML, CSS, and variables to personalize your messages and create a consistent brand experience. The attributes list is available in the [documentation](https://listmonk.app/docs/templating/?ref=blog.elest.io).
