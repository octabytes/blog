We’re blown away by the team at Kaleidos. Committed open\-sourcers like us, they’ve developed the very popular open\-source project management tool Taiga. But today we want to tell you about Penpot (16K stars on github), a phenomenal collaborative design tool.

Penpot, an open\-source alternative to Figma, is a design tool for creating websites, software interfaces and other visual projects. It is a web\-based application that allows designers to create visually rich and interactive prototypes without any coding skills. It has been built to make the designer’s life easier by providing all the key tools in one place. We love it, and we think you will too! [Check it out here on Elestio.](https://elest.io/open-source/penpot?ref=blog.elest.io)

**Latest update**: Adobe acquired Figma for $20B and [users are concerned](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/adobe-buys-figma?ref=blog.elest.io).
