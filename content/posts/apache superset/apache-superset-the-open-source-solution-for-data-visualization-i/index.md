## Installation and Connection to a Database

The first step to using [Apache Superset](https://elest.io/open-source/superset?ref=blog.elest.io) is to install it and connect it to your database. Installation can be done using pip or Docker, if you want to self\-host it, and through the [one click\-install on Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/superset?ref=blog.elest.io). Once installed, you can connect to your database using the web\-based interface. Superset supports many databases, including [MySQL](https://elest.io/open-source/mysql?ref=blog.elest.io), [PostgreSQL](https://elest.io/open-source/postgresql?ref=blog.elest.io), and [SQL Server](https://elest.io/open-source/mssql?ref=blog.elest.io), among others.

## Datasets, Charts \& Dashboards

Once connected to your database, you can start exploring your data in Superset. You can create datasets by selecting your database tables and defining filters and joins. 

You can also create charts using a wide variety of visualization types, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more. Superset also offers many customization options, such as adding filters, legends, and annotations to your visualizations.

## SQL Lab

One of the powerful features of Apache Superset is SQL Lab. This tool allows you to write SQL queries and see the results in a tabular format or as a visualization by using it as a dataset for your charts. This is a bit trickier than the visual editor on Metabase to link multiple tables.

## Conclusion

It offers a user\-friendly interface, supports many databases, and allows you to create beautiful charts and dashboards. While it may be more difficult to use than other tools like Metabase, it offers more advanced charting capabilities but is only compatible with relational SQL databases.
