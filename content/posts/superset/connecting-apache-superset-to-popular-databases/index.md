This guide is for users running an instance of [Apache Superset](https://octabyte.io/applications/business-intelligence/superset) looking to explore and analyze data. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll walk you through how to connect Superset to a new database, set it up for data analysis, and create visualizations. This step\-by\-step guide will help you get hands\-on experience with Superset‚Äôs features for data exploration.

## Connecting Database

For this tutorial, we will connect [PostgreSQL](https://octabyte.io/open-source/postgresql?ref=blog.octabyte.io) as the database but you can implement the same steps to connect any supporting database by Superset. So, log in to the Superset service with the credentials provided in the OctaByte dashboard. Once you are in click on **Settings** and head over to **Database Connections** under the **Data** section.

To quickly add a database connection, click on **\+** \> **Data** \> **Connect database**. 

![Quick connect database setting](https://blog.elest.io/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-11.38.36-AM.jpg)Now you will be prompted with a window to select the database you want to use. We will select PostgreSQL. You can choose to select from the option either from the cards or under supported databases.

For this, head over to your deployed service of Postgres on OctaByte and click on **Show DB Credentials**. We will copy these details and use them in the next steps.

![PostgreSQL database details in OctaByte](https://blog.elest.io/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-11.51.33-AM.jpg)Enter the details you got from the OctaByte dashboard here and give a database name that already exists in the PostgreSQL database. This data in this mentioned database can be used moving forward in Superset. After adding the details click on **Connect** button.

![Database details in Superset database connection](https://blog.elest.io/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-25-at-11.53.26-AM.jpg)You can choose to configure your database connection further with performance, security and other things as required, once done click on **Finish.**
