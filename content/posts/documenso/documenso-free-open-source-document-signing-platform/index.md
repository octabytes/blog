In today’s digital landscape, document signing has become an essential process for both individuals and businesses. E\-signature platforms have emerged as a convenient solution to sign documents. 

While there are plenty of paid options available, [*Documenso*](https://octabyte.io/applications/documentation/documenso) stands out as a free, open\-source alternative that offers all the essential features you need for secure and efficient document signing. 

In this article, we’ll explore the key features that make *Documenso* a powerful tool for digital document workflows.


### eSigning Platform

At the heart of *Documenso* is its robust eSigning platform, designed to facilitate legally binding signatures on digital documents. Whether you need to sign a contract, an agreement, or any other legal document, *Documenso* offers a seamless and secure way to manage signatures. The platform supports various document formats, ensuring compatibility with common file types like PDFs.

The user interface is intuitive, allowing both the sender and recipient to easily navigate the signing process. Signers can review, sign, and submit documents directly from their browser without needing to download any additional software.

### Form Builder

One of the standout features of *Documenso* is its integrated form builder. This tool allows users to easily create and customize forms within their documents. Whether it’s adding fields for signatures, initials, dates, or even custom text fields, the form builder makes it easy to configure your documents for specific signing requirements.

Users can drag and drop form elements onto documents and adjust their placement with ease. This flexibility ensures that every document you send out is tailored to meet the exact needs of your signing process.

### Signers Ordering

Managing the order of signers is a critical aspect of document workflows, especially for multi\-party agreements. *Documenso* allows users to set the order in which signers receive the document, ensuring that each signer is notified and prompted to sign at the appropriate time. 

This feature is particularly useful in hierarchical approval processes where one party’s signature must be obtained before the document moves on to the next.

By configuring the signers’ order, *Documenso* streamlines multi\-signature processes and eliminates any confusion about who needs to sign and when.

### Self Sign Templates

For users who frequently need to sign and send out documents with similar content, *Documenso* provides self\-sign templates. These templates allow users to create reusable document layouts that can be quickly edited and sent out for signatures without the need to manually send them.

For example, if you regularly send out employment contracts or non\-disclosure agreements, you can create a template that includes all necessary fields and simply share a link to let third parties fill their information. 

This feature significantly reduces the time and effort required to manage recurring documents.

### Webhooks

Automation is key to efficient workflows, and *Documenso* supports this through webhooks. Webhooks allow users to automate actions and notifications based on specific events in the document\-signing process. Whether you need to trigger an email when a document is signed or notify a third\-party system, webhooks can help streamline these processes.

With webhooks, organizations can integrate *Documenso* with their internal systems and workflows, ensuring that the document signing process is seamlessly connected to other business operations.

### API

For developers and businesses with more complex needs, *Documenso* offers a well\-documented API that allows for deep integration with other platforms and services. Whether you’re looking to integrate document signing into your own app or create a fully customized document workflow, the API provides the flexibility to extend *Documenso*'s functionality.

Through the API, users can programmatically create, send, and manage documents, as well as retrieve information about the signing process. This makes *Documenso* a scalable solution that can grow with your organization’s needs.

### Conclusion
