## Authentication

Authentication is the cornerstone of any secure system, as it verifies the identity of users trying to access a resource. Zitadel excels at simplifying this process by offering a variety of authentication options, ranging from traditional username\-password mechanisms to modern solutions. Its open\-source nature allows developers to integrate Zitadel into various platforms while maintaining control over customization and scaling.

Zitadel’s authentication services ensure secure and scalable identity verification, helping organizations mitigate security risks and enhance user experience. By leveraging an intuitive API and SDKs, it becomes simple to add authentication capabilities to apps, websites, and services.

## Modern Authentication Methods, SSO, and Social Logins

With the rise of cloud\-native architectures, **modern authentication methods** have become the standard. Zitadel supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2, two widely adopted protocols for secure authentication across platforms. These protocols ensure that users can log into applications without the need for separate credentials, enhancing both security and usability.

**Single sign\-on (SSO)** is a critical feature in today’s interconnected world, allowing users to access multiple services with a single set of credentials. Zitadel offers seamless SSO integration, enabling organizations to unify their authentication infrastructure. This simplifies login procedures for users while reducing the need for password management.

In addition to SSO, **social logins** are also fully supported. Users can authenticate using popular services like Google, Facebook, and GitHub. These options improve the user experience by reducing the need for creating new accounts, all while ensuring security through trusted third\-party platforms.

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Multifactor authentication (MFA)** adds an additional layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Zitadel offers flexible MFA options, allowing developers to implement both time\-based one\-time passwords (TOTP) and WebAuthn for passwordless authentication. WebAuthn, in particular, is a modern and secure approach that leverages hardware tokens or biometrics to authenticate users.

Zitadel's MFA features are easy to configure and provide enterprises with the flexibility to enforce different authentication policies based on user roles, device types, or risk assessments. This ensures that sensitive areas of an application are secured with more stringent measures without compromising usability.

## Authorization

While authentication verifies *who* a user is, **authorization** determines *what* that user can do within the system. Zitadel includes comprehensive authorization features that give fine\-grained control over access to resources. With support for OAuth2 scopes and roles, developers can define complex permission structures that fit the specific needs of their applications.

Zitadel's authorization model allows administrators to delegate responsibilities securely, ensuring that only authorized users can access critical resources. Additionally, its integration with policies such as Role\-Based Access Control (RBAC) makes it simple to scale permissions across large organizations, allowing for easier management of users, roles, and permissions.

## Conclusion

Zitadel is a powerful open\-source platform that simplifies both authentication and authorization for modern applications. Its support for a wide range of authentication methods, including SSO, social logins, and MFA, makes it an attractive solution for developers and businesses. By providing robust authorization features and being fully open\-source, Zitadel ensures that companies can maintain full control over their identity infrastructure while benefiting from enterprise\-grade security.

Whether you're building a cloud\-native application or enhancing the security of existing services, Zitadel offers a scalable, customizable, and secure identity infrastructure platform to meet your needs.
