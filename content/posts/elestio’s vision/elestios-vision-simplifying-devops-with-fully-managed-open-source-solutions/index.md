Managing DevOps can feel overwhelming, especially for small to mid\-sized businesses with limited resources. At Elestio, we understand that while open\-source technology provides incredible flexibility and power, it also brings unique challenges. That’s why we’re thrilled to have been [featured on HostingAdvice](https://www.hostingadvice.com/blog/say-goodbye-devops-with-fully-managed-open-source-platform/?ref=blog.elest.io), where we had the chance to discuss how Elestio is transforming open\-source management for our clients.

### Why We Focus on Fully Managed Solutions

Open\-source software has evolved into an essential resource for businesses looking to innovate quickly without the burden of expensive licensing. But while open\-source tools offer flexibility, they often require in\-depth technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance. For many companies, the time and expertise needed to manage these tools outweigh the cost benefits.

Our goal at Elestio is simple: we want to remove the heavy lifting from your DevOps operations. We believe businesses should focus on growth and customer experience, not the intricacies of server configurations, software updates, or security patches. By offering a fully managed solution, we empower our clients to take advantage of open\-source software without the operational headaches.
