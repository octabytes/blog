## Analytics

At the heart of PostHog lies its robust analytics capabilities. It allows you to collect a wealth of data on user behavior and interactions within your web or mobile application.

The PostHog onboarding process will lead you to add the required SDK to your favorite web and app frameworks to collect your first automated and customized events.

## Cohorts \& Groups

Understanding your users as a whole is crucial, but sometimes, you need to drill down and analyze specific segments. PostHog makes this easy with its Cohorts and Groups features. 

Cohorts allow you to group users based on shared characteristics, while Groups let you segment users dynamically. Whether you're targeting a specific demographic or analyzing user behavior after a new feature release, PostHog helps you pinpoint the data you need.

## Session Recording \& Heatmaps

To truly grasp user interactions, nothing beats watching their actions in real\-time. PostHog's Session Recording feature lets you replay user sessions, gaining insights into how they navigate your product. 

Heatmaps provide a visual representation of user clicks, scrolls, and attention areas, helping you identify pain points and areas for improvement. With these tools, you'll uncover the 'why' behind user behavior.

## Feature Flagging \& AB Testing

In the ever\-evolving landscape of software development, the ability to release and test features is crucial. PostHog's Feature Flagging enables you to manage feature releases seamlessly, allowing you to control who sees what. 

A/B Testing takes experimentation further by letting you test changes and measure their impact on user behavior. PostHog empowers you to iterate quickly and deliver a better user experience.
