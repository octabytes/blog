To truly grasp user interactions, nothing beats watching their actions in real\-time. PostHog's Session Recording feature lets you replay user sessions, gaining insights into how they navigate your product.

In the ever\-evolving landscape of software development, the ability to release and test features is crucial. PostHog's Feature Flagging enables you to manage feature releases seamlessly, allowing you to control who sees what. 

A/B Testing takes experimentation further by letting you test changes and measure their impact on user behavior. PostHog empowers you to iterate quickly and deliver a better user experience.
