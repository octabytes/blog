## Cloud Version vs. Self\-Hosted

Jitsi Meet offers two deployment options: the **cloud version** and **self\-hosted** deployment. 

The cloud version is an excellent choice for quick and hassle\-free video conferences. With a simple sign\-up process, users can initiate meetings instantly, inviting participants via shareable links. The cloud version provides seamless collaboration with real\-time chat, screen sharing, and collaborative document editing. Additionally, it ensures automatic updates and maintenance, saving users valuable time and effort. The downside is **it isn't free**.

On the other hand, the self\-hosted deployment provides users with complete control over their video conferencing infrastructure. Organizations can leverage their existing infrastructure and security measures, ensuring data privacy and compliance. Self\-hosting allows customization, scalability, and integration with other tools. However, it requires technical expertise and resources for installation, configuration, and ongoing maintenance.

With OctaByte, you get the best of both worlds, as we take care of automatic updates and maintenance while offering you the self\-hosted free version.
