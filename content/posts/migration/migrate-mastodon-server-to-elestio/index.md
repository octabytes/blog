> If you imported the Postgres database in the previous step then make sure to import the database in the OctaByte instance by using the Postgres credentials provided on the OctaByte dashboard and also import the media storage.

6. Woohoo! Your data is successfully migrated to OctaByte, wait for a couple of minutes for the data to be imported. You can check the progress for the same on the same tab

### Testing the Migration

1. You have successfully migrated to OctaByte, now it's time for testing if your application is running as you intended

2. Head over to the Mastodon server and check the bookmarks, posts, and list you have imported in their respective tabs and you will notice the mention of your previous server to set the differentiations

3. Here as you can see, my bookmarks were successfully imported into the new instance of OctaByte
