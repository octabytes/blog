### **Assets, Licenses, Accessories, and Consumables**

One of the core functionalities of Snipe\-IT is its robust asset management capabilities. The platform allows you to track a wide range of assets, from laptops and desktops to servers and network devices. Each asset can be categorized, tagged, and assigned to a specific user or department, making it easy to locate and manage resources within your organization.

Snipe\-IT also supports the management of software licenses, ensuring compliance and avoiding over\-purchasing or under\-utilizing licenses. You can keep track of all licenses associated with your assets, monitor expiry dates, and ensure that renewals are handled on time.

In addition to assets and licenses, Snipe\-IT provides the ability to manage accessories and consumables. This feature is particularly useful for tracking items like keyboards, mice, cables, and printer toner. By maintaining an up\-to\-date inventory of these items, organizations can minimize downtime and ensure that replacements are always available when needed.

### **Predefined Kits**

A unique feature of Snipe\-IT is its support for predefined kits. Kits allow you to group multiple assets, accessories, and consumables into a single bundle that can be checked out or assigned to a user.

By using kits, organizations can streamline the asset allocation process, reduce the time spent on administrative tasks, and ensure consistency in asset deployment.

### **People**

Snipe\-IT’s people management module makes it easy to assign assets to users within your organization. You can create detailed user profiles that include contact information, department, role, and asset history. This helps in tracking who is responsible for each asset and facilitates easier communication and management of resources.

The platform also supports integration with Active Directory and LDAP, making it simple to synchronize user data and maintain a single source of truth for user information. By linking assets to specific users, Snipe\-IT ensures accountability and helps prevent asset loss or misuse.

These reports can be customized to suit your specific needs and exported in multiple formats, including CSV and PDF.

The reporting capabilities of Snipe\-IT enable organizations to monitor asset utilization, track depreciation, and make informed decisions about asset procurement and disposal. By keeping a close eye on your assets, you can optimize your IT budget and reduce unnecessary expenditures.
