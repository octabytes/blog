In the dynamic landscape of software development, efficiency, and speed are paramount. 

Imagine a process where your code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed to production without manual intervention. This is the power of **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD), which enhances collaboration, reduces errors, and accelerates your development workflow.
