Automation is key to scaling tasks and improving efficiency, especially for small teams or individual creators. While popular automation tools exist, they often come with high subscription fees and privacy concerns. 

[Automatisch](https://elest.io/open-source/automatisch?ref=blog.elest.io) is a powerful, free, and open\-source alternative that offers flexibility without sacrificing privacy or affordability. Let's dive into what Automatisch has to offer and how it can be used for efficient workflow automation.



Watch our platform overview



## Flows

At the heart of Automatisch are **Flows**, which function as the building blocks of automation. A Flow is a sequence of automated actions designed to perform tasks like notifying your team on Slack, updating records in a CRM, or sending reminders. 

Each Flow has a specific trigger, a series of actions, and customizable conditions that dictate when and how it should run. By breaking down complex workflows into individual steps, Automatisch makes it easy to build processes that fit your needs.

### Trigger

Each Flow begins with a **Trigger** — an event that initiates the sequence of actions. Automatisch supports a wide variety of triggers across multiple apps, so it’s versatile for various use cases. For instance, you might start a Flow when a new row is added in Google Sheets, a customer is created in Stripe, or a message is received in Discord. Setting up a trigger is straightforward, and Automatisch lets you tailor it to specific events, such as filtering based on data changes.

Triggers are the first step in streamlining processes, ensuring actions are automatically initiated based on predefined criteria. Automatisch also provides flexibility by allowing you to set up multiple triggers within a single Flow, ensuring it can adapt to complex scenarios.

### Apps (Stripe, Google, Slack, Discord, …)

Automatisch integrates with a broad range of **Apps**, enabling you to connect popular services like Stripe, Google, Slack, Discord, and many more. Each integration lets you pull and push data between these platforms seamlessly. For example:

* **Stripe**: Automate invoicing, notifications, and customer follow\-ups.
* **Google Suite**: Manage Sheets, Gmail, and Calendar events in one place.
* **Slack**: Send real\-time alerts to channels or direct messages.
* **Discord**: Notify communities or integrate bots into workflows.

By connecting to these services, Automatisch brings together multiple platforms in a single automation ecosystem. With an active development community, you can expect new integrations regularly, increasing the platform’s flexibility over time.

### Built\-in Functions (Delay, Conditions, …)

In addition to apps, Automatisch comes with **Built\-in Functions** that add logic to Flows. These include essential automation tools like:

* **Delay**: Add time\-based delays between steps, useful for spacing out tasks or adding buffers.
* **Conditions**: Implement conditional logic to perform different actions based on the data in the trigger or actions.

These functions make Automatisch more than just a basic automation platform. You can customize each step’s behavior, introducing intelligent decision\-making into your workflows. This is especially helpful for complex automation processes, where conditions allow actions to adapt dynamically based on real\-time data.

### Actions

Once the Trigger has started a Flow, Automatisch executes a series of **Actions** based on the defined steps. Actions are operations like sending an email, creating an invoice, or posting a message in Slack. The platform lets you combine multiple actions in a single Flow, allowing you to sequence tasks across different applications.

For example, you could create a Flow that starts with a Stripe payment, followed by an automated Slack notification, a Google Sheets entry, and a follow\-up email via Gmail. Actions can also be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals, ensuring the right tasks happen exactly when they’re needed.

## Webhooks \& Integrations

For even greater flexibility, Automatisch supports **Webhooks** and **Custom Integrations**. Webhooks allow you to connect to nearly any service that provides webhook capabilities, making Automatisch a truly versatile tool. 

Custom integrations mean that, if an app or service isn’t natively supported, you can still connect it by setting up a webhook to communicate between Automatisch and the app or prepare the native integration yourself.

This feature is perfect for connecting with specialized tools, internal systems, or unique use cases.

## Conclusion

[Automatisch](https://elest.io/open-source/automatisch?ref=blog.elest.io) offers a robust, privacy\-focused, and cost\-effective solution for automating workflows across multiple platforms. Its straightforward interface, versatile triggers, built\-in functions, and wide app support make it an excellent choice for users who need powerful automation without the high price tag. With Automatisch, you can streamline tasks, save time, and focus on what matters most — all while keeping your data secure.
