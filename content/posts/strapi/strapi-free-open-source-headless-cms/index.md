Create your data structure with the many types available from simple ones like text, numbers, and booleans, to advanced ones like relations and images. Then leverage the automatically generated admin UI interface to feed data into your project. You can also use the import features. 

Once your content is ready, define the roles and permissions for your different collections and your backend is ready to be used in the frontend of your choice.
