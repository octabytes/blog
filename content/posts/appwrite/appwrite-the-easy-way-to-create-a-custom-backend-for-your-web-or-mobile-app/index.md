[Appwrite](https://elest.io/open-source/appwrite?ref=blog.elest.io) is a powerful open\-source backend as a service (BaaS) platform that allows developers to create web and mobile applications quickly and easily. What makes Appwrite stand out from other BaaS providers is that it includes a variety of key features right out of the box, such as a built\-in database, authentication, functions, and storage.

With Appwrite's built\-in [database](https://appwrite.io/docs/databases?ref=blog.elest.io), developers don't have to worry about setting up and managing a separate database. The platform comes with a powerful NoSQL database that is scalable and secure, allowing developers to focus on building their application's logic instead of worrying about infrastructure.

Similarly, Appwrite's built\-in [authentication](https://appwrite.io/docs/authentication?ref=blog.elest.io) feature streamlines the process of securing an application. Developers can easily add user authentication and authorization to their application using Appwrite's built\-in system, without the need to integrate with other authentication providers.

One of the great things about Appwrite is its extensive [documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs?ref=blog.elest.io). It includes detailed explanations, tutorials, and examples that can help you get started quickly, even if you're new to backend development. The documentation is well\-organized and easy to navigate, with clear explanations of each feature and function. This makes it simple to find what you're looking for and to understand how to use it effectively.

Another powerful feature of Appwrite is its [functions](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions?ref=blog.elest.io) service. This allows you to execute custom code on the server\-side. With Functions, you can create complex workflows, integrate with external APIs, and perform complex calculations when the existing SDK functions are not covering some logic you need to integrate. This can save you a lot of time and effort, and allow you to create more powerful and flexible applications. 

Finally, Appwrite's built\-in [storage](https://appwrite.io/docs/storage?ref=blog.elest.io) allows developers to store files and other data without needing to use external storage providers. The platform includes a simple and powerful storage API that makes it easy to upload and manage files directly from the application.

By providing these core features out of the box, Appwrite simplifies the development process and allows developers to focus on building great applications without the need to worry about infrastructure.
