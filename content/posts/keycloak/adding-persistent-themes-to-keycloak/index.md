We will see how you can add persistent theme to [Keycloak](https://octabyte.io/open-source/keycloak?ref=blog.octabyte.io). Before we start, make sure you have deployed Keycloak, we will be self\-hosting it on [OctaByte](https://octabyte.io/open-source/n8n?ref=blog.octabyte.io). Keycloak offers robust theme support for its web pages and emails, allowing you to tailor the look and feel of end\-user\-facing pages to seamlessly integrate with your applications.

### Persistent Themes

Keycloak supports mounting themes from a persistent volume, making it easier to manage themes across deployments. By default, the volume mount for themes is at `/opt/keycloack/themes`. Here‚Äôs how to configure it:

1. Access your Keycloak service on [OctaByte Dashboard](https://dash.elest.io/8766/break-and-build/?ref=blog.octabyte.io).
2. Navigate to **Service Overview**.
3. Click the **UPDATE CONFIG** button.
4. Add the following configuration to the Keycloak container:


```
volumes:
   - ./themes:/opt/keycloak/themes

```
1. Click **Apply \& Restart**.

You can copy your theme to the `/opt/app/themes` directory using various methods, such as:

* Using the file explorer available in the service dashboard.
* Utilizing VSCode in the browser (available in the tools tab of the service overview).
* Using SFTP over SSH.
