Security patches, new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements are all goods reason to always stay up\-to\-date. But, it can be really time\-consuming for the DevOps team.   
This is why we have developed an automated update system on OctaByte.  
  
When creating a new service, choose your preferred version, and it will take care of updating your service automatically.

![](https://blog.octabyte.io/content/images/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-05-26-at-10.09.59-3.png)When your service is deployed, we will automatically apply minors updated in the configured maintenance window.  
You can also change the major version from your service overview.
