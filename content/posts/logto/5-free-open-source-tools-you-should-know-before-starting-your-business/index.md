### [\#4 Vaultwarden](https://elest.io/open-source/vaultwarden?ref=blog.elest.io)

When running a business, you will probably have many subscriptions to facilitate your operations. Unfortunately, not all software provides a reliable way to invite team members and handle permissions. In those situations, you might need to share passwords with your team.

Instead of doing it the ugly way by sharing it by message and compromising the security of your accounts, Vaultwarden is the solution to make it securely.

With features such as Groups, Access controls, and two\-step login, you can make it easily with peace of mind. The group feature will contribute to a smooth onboarding for any new team member.

Besides the unique collaboration features, it’s a great product that you can also use privately as your go\-to password manager.

### [\#5 Paperless\-ngx](https://elest.io/open-source/paperless-ngx?ref=blog.elest.io)

Unfortunately, even if you decide to operate your business entirely digitally and paperless, you cannot control what administrations, banks, and other companies will do. You will surely continue to receive letters and documents that you will rarely need. But, when you need them you will spend way too much time finding them.

That’s where Paperless\-ngx comes to the rescue. The perfect tool to transform the scanned version of your physical documents into a searchable online archive before disposing of the paper in the recyclable bin.

It will also automatically perform OCR on your documents, adding searchable, and selectable text from images. By adding some rules, with the easy\-to\-use interface, you will have all your documents sorted within tag\-organized folders.
