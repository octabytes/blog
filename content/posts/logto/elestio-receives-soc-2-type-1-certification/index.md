We are thrilled to announce that OctaByte has achieved SOC 2 Type 1 certification! This certification underscores our ongoing commitment to the security and reliability of our services.

What does this mean for our clients? Firstly, it confirms our dedication to maintaining high standards in data security. Companies using our services can trust that their sensitive information is in safe hands.

The SOC 2 Type 1 certification also demonstrates our responsiveness to our clients compliance and security needs. It attests to the implementation of rigorous controls and procedures to safeguard our clients' data against potential threats.

We take pride in achieving this certification and will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the security and reliability of our services. We thank our clients for their trust and ongoing support. 

**What is SOC 2 compliance?**

A SOC 2 examination provides a detailed report on a service organization's controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These reports aim to fulfill the requirements of various users seeking comprehensive information and assurance about the controls in place to protect the security, availability, and processing integrity of the systems handling users' data, as well as the confidentiality and privacy of the processed information.

**Next steps**

We are currently in the process of obtaining SOC 2 Type 2 certification, which is expected to be completed within the next three months. This strategic endeavor reinforces our unwavering commitment to meeting and surpassing industry benchmarks for data security and reliability. In addition, we are actively pursuing ISO 27001 certification, further solidifying our dedication to maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance for our clients' data.

Our most current SOC 2 report can be obtained from your account representative.
