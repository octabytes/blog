### Free Alternative to Figma, Adobe XD, Canvas

Penpot stands out as a free, open\-source alternative to popular design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Canvas.

The open standards of CSS, SVG, and HTML natively expressed within Penpot make it a natural fit for developers and designers alike. This version 2 release further solidifies its position with impressive new features that enhance both design and development workflows.

### Flex / Grid Layout

One of the standout features in Penpot's version 2 update is the introduction of flex and grid layouts. These layout systems provide designers with the flexibility to create complex, responsive designs that can easily adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 

Whether you're designing a mobile app or a web interface, Penpot's flex and grid layouts enable you to structure your content precisely, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience. This addition makes Penpot a powerful tool for modern interface design, capable of handling intricate layouts with ease.

Penpot's interactive prototyping, feedback, and sharing features keep all stakeholders involved throughout the design process, making it easier to gather input and iterate quickly. The integrated code inspect functionality allows developers to access specs, CSS, and HTML/SVG markups directly within the tool, further simplifying the handoff process.

### Conclusion
